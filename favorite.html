    <h1>HOME</h1>

    <p><strong>HOME</strong> is an animated comedy film about an alien named Oh, who is part of an alien species called the Boov. After an invasion of Earth, Oh befriends a young girl named Tip, and together they embark on an adventure to fix their mistakes and save the planet. It's a heartwarming tale of friendship and belonging.</p>

    <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Tip is a smart and courageous young girl who becomes Oh’s best friend. After being separated from her mother during the Boov invasion, Tip teams up with Oh to find her, showing determination and bravery despite the challenges she faces.</p>

    <p>The plot of Home revolves around Oh's accidental mischief leading to the discovery of Earth’s true value.
